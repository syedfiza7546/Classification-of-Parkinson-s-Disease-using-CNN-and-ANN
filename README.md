# Classification of Parkinson's Disease using CNN and ANN

## Abstract

Parkinson's disease manifests in various ways, including slurred speech, muscle rigidity, tremors, and disruptions in the brain's dopamine production. While therapies can help manage the condition post-diagnosis, there is no known cure. 

This paper analyzes multiple drawing evaluation methods and diagnostic techniques employed for Parkinson's Disease. Using AI deep learning concepts, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the study proposes a model for detecting Parkinson's Disease based on drawings from individuals in two distinct classes. Techniques such as data augmentation, sequential modeling, and CNN were employed for image-based disease detection. 

For acoustic feature data, a Decision Tree and ANN were utilized with GridSearchCV optimization, achieving an impressive 98% accuracy on testing data.

The work was presented at the **International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems in Engineering (ICACITE)** and is available on IEEE Xplore:
